BIOM9450 - Major Project


A major assessment component of this course is a computer-based project that integrates information form the lectures and practical's to produce a workable system that encompasses one aspect of a medical information system. This assessment is a direct test of the degree to which the knowledge-based learning outcomes listed above can be practically applied. Learning outcomes are primarily L3. Related graduate capabilities include:

·         capable of independent, self-directed practice.

·         capable of being enterprising, innovative and creative.

Practically, we will give you access to the materials that are needed for the Major project after week 5, but it will be announced in week 3 to give you a big picture of what you need to do in the Major project.

The Major project must be delivered by the due date (will be announced later).

This task is an example of team-based learning. Therefore, we will divide students into groups with 3 members. The tasks will be divided between the team members to deliver the whole project.

Students will be assigned into groups based on their diagnostic assessment test result. For example, Jimmy (who got a high-level score in the diagnostic assessment test), Hannah (who got a mid-level score), and Karen (who got a low-level score) will be in a same group.

How will we assess the main project?

The score will be divided as below:
30% of the score for individual group member contribution to the project (we will ask each member to run the healthcare system and provide an explanation about the scripts).
70% will go for the whole project. This includes the
final product (60%) + written report (10%).
Individual team member assessment will be based on the task that each team member is responsible for.
We will make a TEAMS channel (under the main TEAMS channel) for each team, separately.
How can you deliver your Major project?

We will give you 15 minutes to deliver your Major project to the instructor. You need to show that your healthcare system works without any issue.
The healthcare system can be run either on i) your own machine; ii) Green room machines.
You can present the Major project either F-2-F (depending on the COVID-19 situation) or through Microsoft TEMAS.
All group members should be in the presentation and must be able to run and explain the product (their healthcare system).
